# Game of life - FrontEnd

This is the frontend for the Conway's Game of Life application, built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/). It provides a UI for visualising the grid with live and dead cells and interact with the simulation.
This application consumers the backend API, which is expected to be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
